# Cat_and_Dog_Recognition_Model
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, with various techniques such as data augmentation, dropout regularization, and hyperparameter tuning applied to improve performance. The final model achieves a classification accuracy on test data and is optimized for generalization to unseen images. The ultimate goal is to build a model capable of accurately differentiating between images of cats and dogs, achieving good performance on a test set.
